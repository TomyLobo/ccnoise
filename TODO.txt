- The speaker block has two front sides when dropped to the floor as an item.
	- custom renderer?
- CCNoise does not behave well when the sound is set to 0%. If you connect to a server that has generated sounds loaded, the client crashes.
	- Lazy sound generation
		- forge sound system init event
	- check if setting to 0 and back breaks anything
		- also keep a list of all generated sounds so i can handle the 

Possible regressions - unconfirmed:
- In SMP, generated sounds might not be unloaded on the client after a computer reboots.


Hard to fix:
- Sound names cannot end in a digit.
